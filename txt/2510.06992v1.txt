 In this contribution, we focus on the Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) models and their exploitation to build reliable reduced order models to further accelerate predictions for real-time applications and many-query scenarios. Specifically, we investigate how machine learning can be employed to enhance the predictive capabilities of the model, both at the Full Order Model (FOM) and Reduced Order Model (ROM) levels.
 We explore a novel integration of these two areas. We generate the FOM snapshots, essential for ROM construction, using a data-driven RANS model: the $_t$-Vector Basis Neural Network. This is the first time that these machine learning procedure generalizes a large parametric variation, and we propose tailored training strategies to increase the accuracy of the FOM model. At the ROM level, we compare the results obtained by standard Proper Orthogonal Decomposition in an intrusive Galerkin setting (PODG) and POD Neural Network approach (PODNN). The numerical validation is based on a classic turbulent flow benchmark: the flow in a square duct. 
 Our investigation reveals that the PODG method, proves unstable and inaccurate for turbulent flow prediction, while PODNN demonstrates superior performance in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency.
